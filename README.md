| Step | Paxos  | Raft  |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Initialization** | No leader. Any node can propose a value. | Nodes start in a follower state. If a follower receives no communication, it becomes a candidate and starts an election. |
| **Election** | Not applicable. | Candidates request votes from all nodes. Any node will vote for the first candidate that asks. The candidate becomes a leader if it receives votes from a majority. |
| **Proposal** | A proposer picks a unique number n and sends a 'prepare' request with number n to a majority of acceptors. | The leader starts sending append entries (heartbeats) to all other nodes. |
| **Promise** | If an acceptor receives a 'prepare' request with number n greater than that of any 'prepare' request to which it has already responded, it responds to the request with a promise not to accept any more proposals numbered less than n. | Not applicable. |
| **Acceptance** | If the proposer receives a response to its 'prepare' requests from a majority of acceptors, it sends an 'accept' request to each of those acceptors for a proposal numbered n with a value v. | If followers donâ€™t hear from a leader then they can become a candidate and start a new election. |
| **Commitment** | If an acceptor receives an 'accept' request for a proposal numbered n, it accepts the proposal unless it has already responded to a 'prepare' request having a number greater than n. | Once a follower learns that its log entry is stored on a majority of servers, it applies the entry to its local state machine. |
| **Learn** | A value is chosen when a proposer issues an 'accept' request and a majority of acceptors respond. | Once the leader learns that a log entry is stored on a majority of servers, it applies the entry to its state machine and returns the result of that execution to the client. |
| **Reconciliation** | If a proposer's 'prepare' request fails because some acceptors have already accepted another proposal, the proposer can issue a new 'prepare' request with a higher number and the value of the highest-numbered proposal among the responses. | The leader ensures that entries committed on former leader are copied to the new leader's log entries. |


Paxos:
Paxos is a family of protocols for solving consensus in a network of unreliable or fallible processors (nodes). Conceptually, the Paxos protocol is a conversation between a proposer, acceptors, and learners. The proposer suggests a value, and the acceptors decide whether to agree or disagree. The learners then learn the chosen value.

The critical point in Paxos is that any proposed value is chosen if a majority of acceptors agree. This means that if a value has been chosen, any majority of acceptors will include at least one acceptor that has agreed, preventing another value from being chosen. This makes it resilient to network partitions and node failures.

Raft:
Raft, on the other hand, simplifies the process by electing a leader in the first phase, who then makes all the decisions until it fails. The election ensures that there's always a majority agreement on who the leader is. The leader then dictates the log entries (which correspond to state changes in the system). Other nodes replicate the leader's log, and the leader ensures that a log entry is safely replicated on a majority of the servers before considering the entry committed.

Here's a comparison:

Complexity: Paxos is notoriously difficult to understand, and as a result, it is also hard to implement correctly. Raft, on the other hand, was designed to be easy to understand. Raft breaks down the consensus problem into three relatively independent subproblems and provides a robust solution for each.

Leadership: In Raft, the leader is elected first and then controls the log replication. In contrast, in Paxos, any node can propose a value, which can lead to more contention and complexity.

Performance: In terms of the number of messages required to reach consensus, Paxos can be more efficient because it allows all nodes to propose values simultaneously. However, this can also lead to more contention. Raft might involve more messaging due to the leader election phase, but it can result in less contention because only the leader can propose changes.

Safety: Both Raft and Paxos are safe under all non-Byzantine conditions, meaning they ensure that only a single value will be chosen. The primary difference between the two protocols lies in their design goals and ease of understandability, not in their safety.

In summary, while Paxos is theoretically powerful, Raft's simplicity makes it a more practical choice for real-world distributed systems. Both ensure that consensus can be reached reliably in a distributed system, even in the face of failures and network partitions.
